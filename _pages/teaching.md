#### Computer Science Department, University of Oxford
- Probabilistic Model Checking, 2021-present
    - Master level course on model checking for Markov Decision Processes. Students learn PCTL and CSL model checking of discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains, respectively.
    - **Students feedback:** ''Always prepared; Punctual; Knowledgeable about everything; Explains questions on assignments very well; Patient on answering all questions''; ''It is clear that he had a very good understanding of the material and also a very strong intuition regarding potential issues we may have.  He provided alternative solutions and interpretations for most problems and really enhanced our understanding of the material.'' 


#### Engineering Science Department, University of Oxford

##### Graduate courses
- AIMS Modern Control Theory. Lecturer, 2021.
    - This course addresses the main concepts of state-space representation (controllability, observability, stability), optimisation, dynamic programming, and how to use them to design feedback controllers.
    - **Students feedback:** "Licio in particular was an amazing teaching assistant, he went out of his way to explain concepts thoroughly.''; ''Licio was a great TA and explained in lots of detail.'' 

##### Undergradute courses
- B15: Control Systems. 2019,2020,2021. 
    - Undergraduate level of an introduction to state-space representation of dynamical systems. Introduction of concepts such as controllability and observatibility, as well as the solution to the LQR control problem and Kalman filtering.
    - **Students feedback:** ''Licioâ€™s been a brilliant tutor this year. I found B15 quite challenging overall but Licio was incredibly supportive and provided good explanations, and extra little resources during the tutorial which were also very helpful.''; ''Very good tutor. Even provided his own notes on the subject so as to give us another explanation/description of the topics which was very helpful.  Good explainer. He would sometimes ask us to run through a problem on the board which would keep us on our toes, but it's good to try these out as a student, as you can show him step-by-step what you're doing which is good for learning.''
