I am a member of [Oxcav](https://oxcav.web.ox.ac.uk/) where I work with [Prof. Alessandro Abate](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/alessandro.abate/home.html) at the intersection of machine learning, verification, and control. I obtained my PhD in June 2021 from the [Department of Engineering Science](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/), Univeristy of Oxford, under the supervision of [Prof. Kostas Margellos](htttps://kostasmargellos.github.io/) and [Prof. Antonis Papachristodoulou](http://sysos.eng.ox.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/User:Antonis). I obtained my MSc in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Campinas (UNICAMP)](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english), Brazil, in 2017, under the supervision of [Prof. Pedro Luis Dias Peres](https://www.fee.unicamp.br/profs/peres/), and BSc in Electrical Engineering from the [Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG)](http://www.ufcg.edu.br/index1.php), Brazil, in 2014. My PhD thesis was awarded the [Institute of Engineering Technology's (IET) Control and Automation Dissertation Prize 2021](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/news/dr-romao-receives-doctoral-dissertation-prize/#:~:text=Postdoctoral). 

A copy of my cv can be found [here](./assets/pdf/CV.pdf).

My research combines techniques from formal verification, control theory, applied mathematics, and machine learning to enable the design of safer and more reliable feedback systems. It focuses on addressing theoretical and practical aspects of the decision-making process under uncertainty. My research interests include:

- **Dynamic programming and reinforcement learning**
- **Abstraction of dynamical systems**
- **Formal verification**
- **Stochastic systems**
- **Stochastic optimization**
- **Feedback control systems**
